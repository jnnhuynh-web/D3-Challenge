# D3 Challenge - Plotting Correlations Between Health Risks, Age, and Income

This data was taken from the [U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html), and measures poverty, age, income, healthcare, obesity, and smoking rates for 2014 sorted by states.

The responsive graph was created in JavaScirpt using the [D3 (Data Driven Documents)](https://d3js.org/) library for enhanced user interaction. The graph has 3 x- and y- axis for the user to select which sets of data to compare.

The tooltip on each datapoint was created using the [d3-tip.js plugin](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip) developed by Justin Palmer. Users can hover over the blue datapoints to view the state and exact values.
